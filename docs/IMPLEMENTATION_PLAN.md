# Alynt Drime WPvivid Uploader Implementation Plan

Updated: 2026-06-22

## Current State

- Development repo exists at `C:\Development\WordPress\Plugins\alynt-drime-wpvivid-uploader`.
- Plugin scaffold is in place with settings, scanner, queue, registry, Drime client, uploader, cron, admin page, uninstall cleanup, README, changelog, and settings docs.
- Diagnostics and observability workflow is complete.
- Build tooling workflow is complete. Composer/npm dependencies are installed, PHPCS/WPCS is configured, and npm build/lint/test scripts pass.
- Pre-release Code Cleanup workflow is complete. Two unused runtime methods were removed: `Alynt_Drime_WPvivid_Uploader_Drime_Client::create_folder()` and `Alynt_Drime_WPvivid_Uploader_Plugin::cron()`.
- Pre-release File Structure Review workflow is complete. Oversized runtime classes were split into focused traits for admin rendering, Drime direct/multipart APIs, uploader multipart/active/retry helpers, scanner metadata, and plugin admin actions; current runtime method inventory has no methods over 50 lines.
- Pre-release Error Handling Review workflow is complete. Settings saves now verify persisted state, scan failures surface as explicit admin notices, diagnostics export has a JSON fallback, direct uploads use bounded cURL timeouts, and admin-post buttons show loading labels.
- Pre-release WP Best Practices Review workflow is complete. The plugin loader now checks minimum WordPress/PHP requirements before loading runtime files that use modern PHP syntax.
- Pre-release Database Review workflow is complete. The plugin has no custom tables or raw SQL; option-backed queue and registry writes now verify persisted state and return explicit failures when WordPress option storage does not update.
- Pre-release Performance Review workflow is complete. Scan queuing now batches uploaded-registry reads and queue writes, and cron clearing skips unscheduled hooks to avoid unnecessary idle-request work.
- Pre-release Edge Cases Review workflow is complete. Upload workers now use a short option-backed lock, clear-active reports abort/state failures honestly, and the delete-local-after-upload setting now performs post-upload local cleanup.
- Pre-release Uninstall Review workflow is complete. Uninstall cleanup now includes the upload worker lock option and removes plugin-owned per-site options and cron hooks across multisite installs.
- Pre-release I18N Review workflow is complete. Text-domain loading now runs early on `plugins_loaded`, all visible diagnostics severity labels and the relative-path placeholder are translatable, and a POT template was generated with WP-CLI.
- Pre-release Accessibility Review workflow is complete. Admin notices now expose live roles, diagnostic data tables have screen-reader captions and scoped headers, and the recent-events empty-state heading follows the page hierarchy.
- Pre-release Code Quality Review workflow is complete. Queue and registry array-option persistence now use a shared storage trait, runtime method inventory has no methods over 50 lines, and the final lint/test/build gate passes.
- Pre-release Documentation Review workflow is complete. Runtime PHPDoc now includes `@since 0.1.0` coverage for class/trait/public-method declarations, README/readme/changelog/settings docs are current, and `docs/HOOKS.md` documents that version `0.1.0` exposes no public custom hooks.
- Pre-release Security Audit workflow is complete. No critical, high, medium, or low blocking issues were found; admin actions are capability/nonce-gated, outputs are escaped, diagnostics are redacted, direct database SQL is absent, dangerous-function scans found only the intentional Drime cURL upload path, and Composer/npm audits are clean.
- Release validation/package refresh is complete for the current source. Final lint, tests, build, npm audit, Composer audit, PHP syntax sweep, distribution zip audit, LocalWP packaged install, and admin render probe passed.
- Drime API schema documentation pass is complete against current public docs, and live-token checks have verified connection, duplicate-validation response shape, available-name response key, direct small-file upload, and the parent-ID duplicate-validation workaround for relative-path uploads.
- WPvivid source verification is complete against installed Free/Pro source and sanitized runtime options; a real single-file database backup fixture has been tested, and a WPvivid-list-backed split-part fixture has validated `.part001.zip` / `.part002.zip` scanner gating. A full backup-engine-generated split backup remains untested.
- Feature security review is complete for the current changed code; multipart signed URLs are validated before upload and diagnostics redacts sensitive substrings in scalar values.
- LocalWP integration has started on `plugin-tester.local`: the plugin is installed/active, the admin page loads, settings save, diagnostics export works, a real WPvivid database backup queues after stable-file scans, that backup uploaded successfully to Drime, duplicate-skip behavior works with the cached Drime parent folder ID, fresh plus interrupted-resume multipart uploads succeeded against Drime, remote multipart abort succeeds through the clear-active path, invalid-token retry handling is verified after auth-preflight hardening, malformed multipart plus HTTP `429` response paths have regression coverage, and a refreshed 33-file packaged release zip has installed/activated successfully through WordPress's upgrader API after the pre-release closeout.
- PHP syntax checks pass across plugin PHP files excluding vendor and node_modules.
- The plugin is installed on `plugin-tester.local` from the packaged release zip `C:\Users\Captain\Desktop\alynt-drime-wpvivid-uploader-0.1.0.zip`.
- The initial scaffold baseline exists at Git commit `7f4b5df`.
- Configurable multipart chunk-size support is implemented, committed, pushed to `origin/master`, and has passed post-feature review workflows plus LocalWP/Drime E2E testing.
- Remote Drime retention is implemented in the current working tree as a conservative manual-only feature: registry-owned uploads only, 60-day default, Drime trash only, and no permanent remote deletion path.
- Remote Drime Retention post-feature review sequence is complete. Feature Light Review, Feature Bloat and Structure Review, Feature UI/UX Implementation Review, and Feature Security Review found no blocking issues. LocalWP dry-run runtime verification and one approved live Drime trash verification are complete.
- v0.5.1 incident hardening is implemented in the current working tree after the first live DrMorses.TV failed upload: Drime control requests now allow a longer timeout, failed upload records preserve safe requeue context, administrators can retry readable failed files from the status UI, and local deletion waits for every WPvivid-listed split part before cleaning up the local set.

### Feature Slice: v0.5.1 Multipart Failure Recovery

Status: implemented in source; pending final feature-stage/release workflow closeout.

#### Trigger

- Live DrMorses.TV `v0.5.0` encountered a terminal failed upload for a large WPvivid split archive part.
- Diagnostics showed repeated slow Drime multipart signing/preflight responses and exposed a recovery hazard: local deletion had already removed the successfully uploaded `part001`, so scanner completeness checks could not naturally requeue the remaining split set.

#### Implemented

- Increased Drime JSON/control-request timeout from 45 seconds to 180 seconds.
- Stored safe failed-upload context in the failed registry: basename, path for local requeue, attempts, size, and sanitized WPvivid set metadata.
- Added an admin Failed Uploads table with per-file `Retry Upload` actions protected by `manage_options` and admin nonces.
- Requeued readable failed files at the front of the upload queue with attempts reset to zero, then cleared the failed record so any later failure is recorded fresh.
- Preserved WPvivid set metadata in uploaded registry records so local cleanup can reason about complete split sets.
- Changed `delete_local_after_upload` behavior for WPvivid-listed multi-file sets: individual parts are kept until all listed parts are uploaded, then the local set is deleted together.

#### Validation

- Added PHPUnit coverage for:
  - extended Drime API timeout;
  - failed registry requeue context;
  - queue prepend behavior;
  - split-set local deletion waiting for incomplete sets;
  - split-set cleanup after the final uploaded part.
- Full PHPUnit and PHPCS are required before release approval.

## Target Test Site

Use the LocalWP profile:

- Site key: `plugin-tester`
- Mode: `local-only`
- LocalWP site name: `Plugin Tester`
- LocalWP domain: `plugin-tester.local`
- WordPress path: `C:\Users\Captain\Local Sites\plugin-tester\app\public`

Before installing or testing on this LocalWP site, follow the Site Operations confirmation gate. Novamira MCP is available and reports both `WPvivid Backup Plugin` and `WPvivid Plugins Pro` active.

## Remaining Implementation Work

### 1. Source Control Baseline

- Review the untracked scaffold.
- Make an initial Git commit before larger feature changes.
- Keep the pre-observability restore point for emergency rollback:
  `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\toolkit-snapshots\alynt-drime-wpvivid-uploader\alynt-drime-wpvivid-uploader-20260619-215013.zip`

### 2. Build And Lint Tooling

Run the toolkit workflow:

```text
@ADD_BUILD_TOOLING_PROMPT.md run
```

Goals:

- Install Composer and npm dependencies.
- Confirm PHPCS/WPCS configuration works on Windows.
- Add or refine test scripts.
- Run lint and fix safe violations.
- Record completion in `PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` only after the workflow completes successfully.

### 3. WPvivid Source Verification

Inspect the installed WPvivid Free and Pro source on `plugin-tester.local`.

Status: complete for source/runtime option verification. See `docs/WPVIVID_RESEARCH.md`.

Verify:

- default and custom local backup path option names
- backup file naming patterns
- split archive naming patterns
- temporary/incomplete file markers
- backup history/task option structures
- any stable action/filter hooks that signal backup completion

Expected output:

- `class-wpvivid-detector.php` reads the verified WPvivid local path options, including Pro `outside_folder` mode.
- Scanner candidates include WPvivid backup-set metadata when `wpvivid_backup_list` is available.
- Verified assumptions are documented in `docs/WPVIVID_RESEARCH.md`.

### 4. Drime API Schema Verification

Confirm exact request/response schemas against current Drime docs and, when a token is available, safe live test calls.

Status: documentation pass complete against current public Drime docs. Live-token checks have verified connection, duplicate-validation response shape, available-name response key, relative-path direct upload, direct upload response shape, and cached parent-ID duplicate validation. See `docs/DRIME_API_RESEARCH.md`.

Verify:

- token test endpoint
- folder creation behavior
- duplicate validation response shape (verified; relative-path duplicate detection remains unreliable)
- available-name response shape (verified live key is `available`, not documented `name`)
- small upload endpoint behavior (verified with a real WPvivid database backup)
- multipart create response keys
- signed part URL response shape
- ETag formatting requirements
- complete multipart response shape
- abort multipart response shape
- `/s3/entries` registration body and response shape
- whether `relativePath`, `parentId`, and `workspaceId=0` behave as expected (partially verified; remote duplicate detection requires top-level `parentId`)

Expected output:

- update `class-drime-client.php` field names and parsers
- add defensive handling for malformed responses
- document verified schemas in `docs/DRIME_API_RESEARCH.md`
- store resolved Drime parent folder IDs after relative-path uploads so future duplicate validation can send top-level `parentId`

### 5. Scanner And Queue Hardening

Improve MVP scanner behavior after WPvivid verification.

Status: mostly complete. Scanner candidates now include WPvivid backup-set metadata, WPvivid-listed sets are queued only after every listed file is present and stable, valid `.partNNN.zip` split archives are preserved while raw temporary `.part` files are ignored, orphaned split archive parts are skipped, duplicate queue handling checks path and WPvivid backup-id/name identity, retry cap enforcement is implemented, and stale active-upload state is cleared after six hours.

Needed:

- group split backups into complete backup sets (done for WPvivid backup-list-backed sets; runtime WPvivid-list-backed split fixture validated; full generated split backup still untested)
- prevent queueing partial/incomplete backup sets (done for WPvivid backup-list-backed sets and orphaned split parts)
- store set-level metadata where needed (done for scanner candidates)
- improve duplicate queue handling (done for local path and WPvivid backup-id/name identity)
- add retry cap enforcement (done)
- add stale active-upload recovery behavior (done)

### 6. Upload Flow Hardening

Improve uploader reliability before real backup testing.

Status: mostly complete. Direct small-file upload is verified live with a real WPvivid database backup. Fresh multipart upload and interrupted multipart resume are verified live with temporary `.zip` fixtures over the multipart threshold. Multipart active state is persisted without presigned URLs, same-item active state can resume, uploaded parts are fetched with `get-uploaded-parts`, completed part numbers are skipped, signed upload URLs are validated as safe HTTPS URLs before sending backup bytes, malformed signed URL payloads fail before bytes are uploaded, every upload is gated by a JSON token preflight, invalid-token and HTTP `429` preflight handling stop before byte upload, the admin can clear local active upload state and abort the remote multipart upload when possible, cached relative-path parent IDs are used for reliable remote duplicate validation, and tests cover fresh/resumed/abort/auth-preflight/malformed-response/rate-limit multipart control flow.

Needed:

- verify small-file upload path or replace it with the documented Drime upload flow if needed (done with live direct upload)
- support multipart resume using saved state and `get-uploaded-parts` (implemented and live-validated with an interrupted upload)
- persist multipart state after each uploaded part (done)
- add abort/clear stale upload state (done; manual clear abort live-validated, stale clear covered by PHPUnit)
- ensure local deletion remains disabled by default and requires explicit admin opt-in
- avoid logging file contents, tokens, presigned URLs, or raw request bodies (diagnostics key-based and scalar substring redaction implemented)
- use top-level `parentId` for Drime duplicate validation after a relative-path upload has resolved the concrete parent folder (done)
- block uploads when the JSON token preflight fails, even if an upload endpoint would otherwise accept the request (done)
- reject malformed multipart create/sign responses before upload completion or Drime entry registration (done with regression coverage)
- handle HTTP `429` rate-limit responses without uploading backup bytes (done with regression coverage; live rate-limit induction intentionally not forced)

### Planned Feature Slice: Remote Drime Retention

Status: implemented in current working tree. Post-feature review sequence, LocalWP dry-run runtime verification, and one approved live Drime trash verification are complete.

Goal:

- Add optional controls for deleting old Drime files uploaded by this plugin.
- Keep the first implementation conservative: move files to Drime trash only, not permanent deletion.
- Limit cleanup candidates to plugin-owned uploaded-registry entries unless a later feature explicitly adds Drime-folder enumeration.
- Keep remote retention separate from the existing local post-upload delete setting.

Recommended first slice:

- Add settings for remote retention:
  - `remote_retention_enabled`, default disabled. Done.
  - `remote_retention_days`, default `60`, clamped to `1` through `365`. Done.
  - No permanent-delete setting in the first version. Hard-code `deleteForever=false`. Done.
- Add a Drime client method for `POST /file-entries/delete` after re-verifying the current request and response schema against live API behavior. Done.
- Add a focused retention service/class that selects eligible uploaded-registry records, calls the Drime delete endpoint, updates registry state, and writes diagnostics events. Done.
- Use local registry `uploaded_at` age as the authoritative retention clock for the first version. Done.
- Skip records without a verified Drime `fileEntry.id`, records newer than the configured age, and records already marked as trashed/deleted or `trash_failed`. Done.
- Preserve uploaded-registry records after remote trashing and mark them with a remote status such as `uploaded`, `trashed`, or `trash_failed` so local files are not silently re-uploaded. Done.
- Prefer a manual admin action with dry-run/preview output for the first implementation. Add scheduled automatic cleanup only after the behavior is proven locally and against Drime. Done; no scheduled cleanup was added.
- Add admin UI in the settings/admin page for enablement, retention days, dry-run status, and a manual cleanup action. Treat cleanup as destructive: capability gate, nonce gate, clear copy, and explicit action feedback. Done.
- Add diagnostics events such as `retention_started`, `retention_candidate_found`, `retention_file_trashed`, `retention_failed`, and `retention_finished`. Done.

Tests and verification:

- Unit-test settings sanitization for disabled state, day bounds, and default behavior. Done.
- Unit-test candidate selection: disabled retention, missing Drime ID, new files, old files, already-trashed files, and failed prior attempts. Done.
- Unit-test Drime delete request shape and response handling with `deleteForever=false`. Done.
- Unit-test success and failure registry updates, including preserving records after trashing. Done.
- Verify no code path performs permanent remote deletion in the first version. Done by static implementation, unit test coverage, and approved live runtime trash verification with `deleteForever=false`.
- Run the post-feature workflows after implementation: Feature Light Review, Feature Bloat and Structure Review, Feature UI/UX Implementation, and Feature Security Review. Done.
- Use the Site Operations confirmation gate and ask for Novamira MCP availability before any LocalWP runtime testing. Done for the LocalWP dry-run pass.

Open decisions before implementation:

- Confirm the default retention period. Implemented with the candidate default of 60 days.
- Confirm whether the first release should be manual-only with dry-run, or whether scheduled cleanup should ship in the same slice. Implemented as manual-only with preview; scheduled cleanup was intentionally deferred.
- Confirm whether existing Drime test uploads should be cleaned up as a separate manual maintenance task. Done for the known leftover E2E upload, which was moved to Drime trash after explicit approval.

### Feature Slice: Failed Upload Email Notifications

Status: implemented in source. LocalWP runtime mail-stack verification and post-feature review workflows are pending.

Goal:

- Notify administrators when a Drime upload reaches a meaningful failure state so unattended backup workflows do not fail silently.
- Use WordPress-native mail delivery through `wp_mail()` so SMTP plugins such as FluentSMTP, SureMail, WP Mail SMTP, and Post SMTP can handle transport automatically.
- Avoid notification spam from repeated cron retries, bad tokens, or transient Drime/API failures.

Recommended first slice:

- Add settings:
  - `failure_email_enabled`, default disabled. Done.
  - `failure_email_recipients`, default to `get_option( 'admin_email' )`. Done.
  - Optional `failure_email_test_recipient` is not needed if the test action uses the saved recipients. Done; no separate test-recipient setting was added.
- Add a notification service/class that:
  - builds plain-text email messages for failed uploads. Done.
  - sends with `wp_mail()`. Done.
  - records diagnostics for sent, skipped, and failed notification attempts. Done.
  - never includes Drime tokens, presigned URLs, raw request bodies, file contents, or stack traces. Done by limiting message fields and sanitizing/redacting failure reasons.
- Send notifications only when an upload becomes terminally failed:
  - manual upload action returns `WP_Error`. Done.
  - queue retry cap is reached and the item is marked failed/removed. Done.
- Do not send on every retry attempt. Done.
- Deduplicate notifications by backup signature plus failure state so repeated cron runs do not send the same alert repeatedly. Done.
- Add a manual admin action to send a test notification through the current WordPress mail stack. Done.
- Include a clear admin notice after the test action:
  - success when `wp_mail()` returns true. Done.
  - actionable failure copy when `wp_mail()` returns false. Done.
- Keep the first version plain text. Defer HTML templates unless there is a specific need. Done.

Email content:

- Subject: include site name and plugin context, such as `[Site Name] Drime backup upload failed`.
- Body should include:
  - site URL,
  - backup filename,
  - failure status/reason in sanitized plain language,
  - attempt count when available,
  - timestamp,
  - admin page URL for Tools > Drime WPvivid.
- Do not expose absolute server paths in the email unless explicitly approved later.

Tests and verification:

- Unit-test settings sanitization for enabled state and recipient list parsing.
- Unit-test notification dedupe behavior.
- Unit-test that `wp_mail()` is called with expected recipients, subject, message, and plain-text headers.
- Unit-test that disabled notifications do not send.
- Unit-test failure paths when `wp_mail()` returns false.
- Source unit coverage added for settings parsing, dedupe behavior, `wp_mail()` call shape, disabled notification behavior, failed mail results, and test-email delivery through saved recipients.
- Verify LocalWP runtime with the active site mail stack:
  - send test email through the plugin action,
  - confirm diagnostics record the notification attempt,
  - if SureMail or another SMTP/logging plugin is active, confirm the email appears in that plugin's logs without exposing secrets.
- Run feature-stage workflows after implementation:
  - `FEATURE_LIGHT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`
  - `FEATURE_BLOAT_AND_STRUCTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md` if changed PHP/JS/CSS warrants it
  - `FEATURE_UI_UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`
  - `FEATURE_SECURITY_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`

Open decisions before implementation:

- Confirm whether notifications should default to disabled or enabled. Recommended: disabled for the first release.
- Confirm whether recipients should allow comma-separated emails, one email per line, or both. Implemented: both, normalized one per line internally.
- Confirm whether the first trigger should include manual upload failures, terminal cron failures, or both. Implemented: both, deduped by backup signature and failure state.
- Confirm whether to include absolute local backup paths in email. Implemented: no; emails use basenames only and redact URL/path substrings in failure reasons.

### Feature Slice: Drime Folder Browser And Destination Validator

Status: implemented in source. PHPUnit, PHPCS, build verification, and LocalWP/Drime runtime E2E are complete.

Goal:

- Let administrators browse existing Drime folders directly from the plugin settings page instead of manually extracting folder IDs from Drime URLs.
- Keep the existing storage model backward-compatible: the selected base folder maps to `parent_folder_id`, and the typed site folder/subpath maps to `relative_path`.
- Support the practical workflow:
  - Select existing base folder: `General/Files/Backups`.
  - Type site folder: `site1.com`.
  - Upload destination resolves to `General/Files/Backups/site1.com`.
  - If `site1.com` already exists under the selected base folder, use it.
  - If `site1.com` does not exist, let the existing upload path creation flow create it before upload.
- Reduce destination mistakes by showing the resolved human-readable destination before uploads run.

Drime API references to verify during implementation:

- API base URL is `https://app.drime.cloud/api/v1`.
- Authentication uses the saved bearer token.
- `GET /cli/loggedUser` returns the authenticated user ID needed by the user-folder endpoint.
- `GET /users/{userId}/folders?workspaceId=0` returns a folder tree with `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `path`, `workspace_id`, and often `hash`.
- `GET /drive/file-entries?workspaceId=0&type=folder&folderId={folderHash}` can list folder children, and supports pagination/search filters.
- `GET /folders/{folderHash}/path` returns a breadcrumb path for display.
- `POST /folders?workspaceId=0` creates a folder with `name` and `parentId`; keep this write path behind existing upload destination creation or an explicit future "Create Missing Folders" action.

Recommended first slice:

- Add Drime client methods:
  - `get_logged_user()`. Done.
  - `list_user_folders( $workspace_id )`. Done.
  - `list_folder_entries( $workspace_id, $folder_hash, $page, $query )`. Done.
  - `get_folder_path( $folder_hash )`. Done.
  - Reuse the existing create-folder/path-resolution code where possible instead of duplicating destination creation. Done; browsing and preview do not create folders.
- Add settings fields or metadata while preserving existing settings:
  - `parent_folder_id` remains the canonical upload anchor. Done.
  - `relative_path` remains the canonical subpath/site-folder field. Done.
  - Add optional non-secret display metadata such as `parent_folder_hash` and `parent_folder_display_path` if needed for breadcrumbs and validation. Done.
  - Existing installs with only a manually entered `parent_folder_id` must keep working. Done; preview can resolve the hash from the user-folder list when possible.
- Add a WordPress-native folder browser UI in the existing settings page:
  - Button: `Browse Drime Folders`. Done.
  - Browsing panel or modal lists folders with Name, Path/Breadcrumb, and actions. Done.
  - Row actions: `Open` and `Use as Base Folder`. Done.
  - Show selected base folder as human-readable text and keep the raw folder ID visible or available for advanced users. Done.
  - Keep the site folder field as normal text input, with help text explaining that missing folders are created during upload. Done.
  - Add `Preview Destination` / `Validate Destination` action that resolves the selected base folder plus relative path and reports existing vs missing folder segments without uploading backup bytes. Done.
- Use `wp_ajax_` admin actions for browser interactions:
  - Gate with `manage_options`. Done.
  - Verify nonces for every request. Done.
  - Return sanitized JSON only. Done.
  - Do not expose the saved Drime token in responses, diagnostics, browser data attributes, or JavaScript. Done.
  - Add visible loading states, disabled buttons during requests, and an `aria-live` status region. Done.
- Keep the first implementation read-safe by default:
  - Browsing and destination preview are read-only API calls. Done.
  - Do not create folders merely by browsing/selecting a base folder. Done.
  - Continue creating missing relative-path folders only when the upload path actually needs them, unless a later explicit manual "Create Missing Folders" action is approved. Done.
- Add diagnostics events:
  - `folder_browser_loaded`. Done.
  - `folder_browser_failed`. Done.
  - `destination_preview_started`. Done.
  - `destination_preview_finished`. Done.
  - `destination_preview_failed`. Done.
  - Redact URLs/tokens as the existing diagnostics layer already requires. Done.

Tests and verification:

- Unit-test Drime client request shapes and response parsing for logged-user, folder tree, file entries, and folder path endpoints. Done.
- Unit-test settings sanitization for any new display metadata fields. Done.
- Unit-test that old settings with only `parent_folder_id` and `relative_path` still resolve uploads the same way. Done for upload request/body behavior.
- Unit-test that AJAX handlers require `manage_options` and valid nonces. Pending; handlers are implemented with capability and nonce checks and need runtime/E2E verification.
- Unit-test that AJAX responses never include the API token. Done at service normalization level; runtime AJAX response inspection remains pending.
- Unit-test destination preview behavior for:
  - existing base folder and existing site folder. Done.
  - existing base folder and missing site folder. Done.
  - invalid/missing parent folder. Done.
  - Drime API error. Done.
  - empty relative path. Done.
- Verify in LocalWP with `plugin-tester local-only` after the Site Operations confirmation gate:
  - Confirm Novamira MCP is available before starting; if unavailable, stop and ask the user to enable it.
  - Browse folders with the saved Drime token.
  - Select `General/Files/Backups`-style base folder.
  - Type a site folder such as `site1.com`.
  - Preview the resolved destination.
  - Confirm upload behavior still creates/uses the final relative path correctly.

Feature-stage workflows to run after implementation, in this order:

1. `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds2-feature\FEATURE_LIGHT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`
2. `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds2-feature\FEATURE_BLOAT_AND_STRUCTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`
   - Applicable because this feature will likely add PHP and JavaScript for AJAX/admin UI.
3. `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds2-feature\FEATURE_UI_UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`
   - Applicable because the feature changes admin settings UI and async interactions.
4. `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds2-feature\FEATURE_SECURITY_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`
   - Applicable because the feature uses saved tokens, AJAX, remote API calls, and settings writes.
5. `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds6-maintenance\DOCUMENTATION_SYNC_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`
   - Applicable after implementation because README/readme/settings docs and changelog will need to match the UI and behavior.

End-to-end testing workflow to run after implementation and feature-stage reviews:

- Run `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Task Workflows\WordPress\wordpress-component-testing-troubleshooting-debugging-workflow.md` against the plugin on `plugin-tester local-only`.
- Do a full plugin E2E pass, including the new Drime folder browser, destination preview, settings save/reload, WPvivid scan/upload path, diagnostics, and debug/runtime evidence.
- Ensure Novamira MCP is available before the E2E pass. If it is unavailable, stop and let the user enable it before continuing.

Release workflow after successful implementation and E2E:

- Run `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds5-git\GIT_OPERATIONS_PROMPT.md` Option C.
- Follow the mandatory release approval checkpoint before commit/tag/push/GitHub release publishing.

Implementation decisions:

- The browser starts from the user-folder list and supports child navigation by folder hash instead of creating folders or loading every nested child eagerly.
- The plugin stores non-secret `parent_folder_hash` and `parent_folder_display_path` metadata so saved selections can display and preview cleanly.
- The first version includes read-only preview only; there is no manual `Create Missing Folders` action.
- LocalWP/Drime E2E showed direct uploads do not reliably honor `relativePath` alongside `parentId`; upload processing now resolves or creates the final concrete destination folder when needed, then uploads to that folder ID.

### Feature Slice: Drime Workspace Picker

Status: implemented in source. Feature-stage review, documentation sync, and release verification are pending for this slice.

Goal:

- Let administrators retrieve and select a Drime workspace from the plugin settings screen instead of manually typing workspace IDs.
- Keep `workspace_id` as the canonical stored setting and keep `0` as the personal/default Drime workspace.
- Keep workspace browsing read-only. Loading workspaces must not create folders, change Drime account state, or expose the saved bearer token.
- Clear selected base-folder metadata when the workspace changes so a folder ID from one workspace is not accidentally reused in another workspace.

Verified API reference:

- `GET /me/workspaces` returns all workspaces available to the authenticated token.
- The API response includes a `workspaces` array with fields such as `id`, `name`, `members_count`, `currentUser.role_name`, and owner/current-user flags.
- Drime's workspace context rule remains: use `workspaceId=0` for the personal/default workspace and a specific workspace ID for team workspaces.

Implementation plan:

- Add a Drime client method:
  - `list_workspaces()`.
- Add a workspace browser service that normalizes the Drime response into sanitized, non-secret rows for the admin UI.
- Add a `wp_ajax_` admin action:
  - `alynt_drime_wpvivid_list_workspaces`.
  - Gate with `manage_options`.
  - Verify the existing folder-browser/admin nonce.
  - Return sanitized JSON only; never return the token, raw account payload, or sensitive account details.
- Add a WordPress-native settings UI:
  - Keep the manual numeric `Workspace ID` field for advanced/manual fallback.
  - Add `Load Drime Workspaces`.
  - Populate a native `<select>` with the personal/default workspace and returned team workspaces.
  - Selecting a workspace updates `workspace_id`, clears selected base-folder metadata, and tells the user to save settings.
- Add tests:
  - client endpoint coverage for `/me/workspaces`.
  - response normalization coverage.
  - settings coverage that changing workspaces clears stale parent-folder metadata.

Release workflow after successful implementation and E2E:

- Run the applicable feature-stage prompts in this order:
  - `FEATURE_LIGHT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`.
  - `FEATURE_BLOAT_AND_STRUCTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`.
  - `FEATURE_UI_UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`.
  - `FEATURE_SECURITY_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`.
  - `DOCUMENTATION_SYNC_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`.
- Run `C:\Users\Captain\Documents\AI Workflows\Toolkits\wp-plugin-toolkit\d4-prompts\ds5-git\GIT_OPERATIONS_PROMPT.md` Option C.
- Follow the mandatory release approval checkpoint before commit/tag/push/GitHub release publishing.

### 7. Admin UX Pass

Run the UI workflow after the core feature paths are stable:

```text
@FEATURE_UI_UX_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md run
```

Status: complete for the current admin screen. The pass connected help text with `aria-describedby`, added missing action feedback notices, improved error copy, applied destructive button styling for clear actions, added diagnostics settings controls, and ensured disabled action buttons also set `aria-disabled`.

Focus:

- settings layout and labels
- diagnostics table readability
- manual action feedback
- empty states
- confirmation for destructive actions
- accessibility of buttons, form controls, notices, and status messages

### 8. Feature Security Review

Status: complete for the current changed feature code.

Findings/fixes:

- Admin form/action handlers are guarded by `manage_options` and `check_admin_referer()`.
- Diagnostics export and admin UI output are capability-gated and escaped/redacted.
- Drime multipart part uploads now use `wp_safe_remote_request()` and reject unsafe or non-HTTPS signed URLs before transmitting backup bytes.
- Diagnostics now redacts bearer tokens and HTTP(S) URLs when they appear inside scalar values such as transport error messages, not only when sensitive context keys are used.

Verification:

- `npm.cmd run lint` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed: 24 tests, 64 assertions.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.
- Changed PHP files passed `php -l`.
- `git diff --check` passed with existing CRLF warnings only.

### 9. LocalWP Install And Integration Test

Status: partially complete on `plugin-tester.local`.

Verified:

- Plugin runtime files were copied into `C:\Users\Captain\Local Sites\plugin-tester\app\public\wp-content\plugins\alynt-drime-wpvivid-uploader` and activated.
- Current Remote Drime Retention runtime files were copied into the LocalWP plugin directory after Novamira MCP became available.
- Remote Drime Retention dry-run verification passed through Novamira MCP: the class and plugin method load, defaults merge as disabled/60 days, preview selects only old plugin-owned uploaded-registry records with Drime file-entry IDs, admin UI renders retention controls and candidate output, options are restored exactly after probes, and no remote Drime delete/trash request was executed during dry-run.
- Remote Drime Retention live-trash verification passed after explicit approval: preview isolated only `alynt-e2e-chunk-20260620-144909.zip` with Drime entry id `760413126`, cleanup returned `candidates=1`, `trashed=1`, `failed=0`, `skipped=0`, settings were restored, the E2E upload is now marked `remote_status=trashed`, and the real WPvivid database backup remains `uploaded`.
- Remote retention-day sanitization now clamps signed input to the supported 1-365 range; LocalWP runtime confirmed `-5` becomes `1` and `999` becomes `365` without writing options.
- Default settings option was installed; auto-scan cron remains unscheduled while automatic scanning is disabled.
- Admin page loads in wp-admin with no console errors.
- Settings save works through `admin-post.php`.
- Diagnostics controls render, diagnostics settings persist through a normal save, and diagnostics export returns JSON without bearer tokens or `api_token`.
- WPvivid generated a real local database backup: `plugin-tester.local_wpvivid-0d2ea337c5c5b_2026-06-19-21-45_backup_db.zip`.
- Scanner first captured the new backup snapshot without queueing, then queued it on the second scan after size/age stability was established.
- Queued item includes `wpvivid_backup_list` metadata with `from_list: true`, backup id `wpvivid-0d2ea337c5c5b`, and one listed file.
- Upload without a Drime token fails safely, leaves active upload state empty, increments attempts to 1, records one failed item, and logs redacted diagnostics.
- Earlier live Drime upload test state verified the queue empty, uploaded registry count `1`, failed registry count `0`, active upload state empty, diagnostics enabled at debug level, minimum file age set to 60 seconds, and the resolved Drime parent folder ID cached for the configured relative path. Latest packaged install validation is recorded separately below.
- Packaged zip validation passed after the pre-release closeout: `C:\Users\Captain\Desktop\alynt-drime-wpvivid-uploader-0.1.0.zip` contains 33 production files, has the expected top-level plugin folder and main plugin file, uses forward-slash zip entries, excludes dev/tooling/handoff/generated files including `assets/dist`, installed over the LocalWP runtime copy through WordPress's `Plugin_Upgrader` with `overwrite_package=true`, activated successfully, rendered the admin page in a WordPress runtime probe, preserved plugin options, and left queue count `0`, failed count `0`, uploaded registry count `0`, and active upload empty.

Pending:

- Duplicate handling against existing Drime files is partially verified. Local registry prevention is verified, and Drime remote duplicate-skip behavior was validated using a copied backup with the same basename and the cached top-level `parentId`; relative-path-only request variants remain unreliable.
- Malformed multipart failure shapes have unit coverage for create/sign response failures; HTTP `429` rate-limit behavior has unit coverage. Live rate-limit induction remains untested to avoid abusive API traffic.
- Live Remote Drime Retention cleanup has been verified once against the approved leftover E2E test upload; broader arbitrary-folder cleanup is intentionally out of scope for this feature.

Use `plugin-tester local-only` after the confirmation gate.

Test sequence:

- install and activate plugin on `plugin-tester.local`
- confirm admin page loads
- save settings without token and verify validation behavior
- enable diagnostics and verify redacted logs
- scan WPvivid backup folder
- create a manual WPvivid backup
- confirm scanner waits for file stability
- queue backup or backup set
- upload tiny test file when safe
- upload real WPvivid backup archive
- upload a multipart-threshold test archive
- resume an interrupted multipart-threshold test archive
- confirm file appears visibly in Drime
- confirm duplicate handling prevents re-upload

### 10. Failure Testing

Test:

- missing token
- invalid token
- unreadable backup folder
- missing local file after queueing
- interrupted multipart upload
- Drime API error
- malformed Drime response (multipart create/sign response and HTTP `429` unit coverage added; broader live malformed/rate-limit cases pending if safe)
- duplicate remote filename
- disabled diagnostics
- diagnostics export and clear actions

### 11. Pre-Release Review Sequence

After MVP functionality works locally, run the pre-release sequence:

```text
@01-CODE_CLEANUP_PROMPT.md run
@02-FILE_STRUCTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@03-ERROR_HANDLING_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@04-WP_BEST_PRACTICES_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@05-DATABASE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@06-PERFORMANCE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@07-EDGE_CASES_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@08-UNINSTALL_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@09-I18N_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@10-ACCESSIBILITY_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@11-CODE_QUALITY_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@12-DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW_PROMPT.md run
@13-SECURITY_AUDIT_PROMPT.md run
```

Record each completed workflow in `PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` only after successful completion.

Status:

- `@01-CODE_CLEANUP_PROMPT.md run` through `@13-SECURITY_AUDIT_PROMPT.md run` completed on 2026-06-20 and are recorded in `PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Final release validation lint/test/build rows completed on 2026-06-20 and are recorded in `PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
