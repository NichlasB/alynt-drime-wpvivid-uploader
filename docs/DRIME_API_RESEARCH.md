## Verified From Current Docs

- Base API URL is `https://app.drime.cloud/api/v1`.
- Requests use Bearer token authentication in the `Authorization` header.
- Personal/default workspace uses `workspaceId=0`.
- Direct upload endpoint is `POST /uploads` using `multipart/form-data`.
- Direct upload accepts `file`, `workspaceId`, optional `parentId`, and optional `relativePath`.
- Direct upload response should include `status` and `fileEntry`.
- Duplicate validation endpoint is `POST /uploads/validate?workspaceId=0`.
- Duplicate validation request body is `files`, with file objects containing `name`, `size`, and `relativePath`.
- Duplicate validation response should include `status`, `errors`, and `duplicates`.
- Available-name endpoint is `POST /entry/getAvailableName`.
- Available-name request body includes `name`, `parentId`, and `workspaceId`.
- Available-name response should include `name`.
- Multipart create endpoint is `POST /s3/multipart/create`.
- Multipart create request body includes `filename`, `mime`, `size`, `extension`, `workspaceId`, and optionally `relativePath` or `parentId`.
- Multipart create response should include `key`, `uploadId`, `acl`, and `status`.
- Part signing endpoint is `POST /s3/multipart/batch-sign-part-urls`.
- Part signing request body includes `key`, `uploadId`, and 1-indexed `partNumbers`.
- Part signing response should include `urls`, with each item containing `partNumber` and `url`.
- Complete multipart endpoint is `POST /s3/multipart/complete`.
- Complete multipart request body includes `key`, `uploadId`, and `parts`.
- Each completed part must use `PartNumber` and `ETag`; docs show ETags with quotes included.
- Complete multipart response should include `location` and `status`.
- Abort multipart endpoint is `POST /s3/multipart/abort`.
- Abort multipart request body includes `key` and `uploadId`; docs say it cancels in-progress uploads and cleans up uploaded parts.
- Abort multipart response should include `status`.
- Resume endpoint is `POST /s3/multipart/get-uploaded-parts`.
- Resume response should include `parts`, with `PartNumber`, `ETag`, and `Size`.
- S3 entry registration endpoint is `POST /s3/entries`.
- S3 entry body includes `filename`, `size`, `clientName`, `clientMime`, `clientExtension`, `workspaceId`, and optionally `parentId` or `relativePath`.
- S3 entry response should include `status` and `fileEntry`.

## Code Updates Made

- Direct small-file uploads now pass `relativePath` when configured, otherwise they pass `parentId`.
- The Drime client now treats non-empty, non-JSON responses as malformed.
- Duplicate validation now requires a `duplicates` array.
- Available-name lookup now accepts Drime's live `available` response key and falls back to the documented `name` key.
- Duplicate validation can send a top-level `parentId` when the plugin has resolved a concrete Drime parent folder for a configured relative path.
- Successful relative-path uploads now remember the returned `fileEntry.parent_id` for later duplicate validation.
- Direct upload and S3 registration now require a `fileEntry` object.
- Multipart create now requires `key` and `uploadId`.
- Part signing now requires a `urls` array.
- Multipart signed URL extraction now rejects non-scalar `url` values before any backup bytes are uploaded.
- Multipart completion now requires `location`.
- Resume lookup now requires a `parts` array.
- Multipart active state stores the S3 `key`, Drime `uploadId`, completed part metadata, local filename, remote name, queue signature, and timestamps.
- Presigned part URLs are not persisted.
- Resume asks Drime for uploaded parts, skips already completed part numbers, uploads missing parts, completes the multipart upload, and creates the S3 entry.
- Admin recovery can clear local active upload state without exposing raw multipart state in the UI.
- Admin recovery and stale active-state recovery now abort the remote multipart upload when the active state includes a Drime `key` and `uploadId`.
- The uploader now runs a JSON API token preflight before any duplicate validation or file-byte upload.
- Malformed response handling now records a redacted diagnostics event and returns `WP_Error`.
- HTTP `429` rate-limit responses return `alynt_drime_api_error` with status `429`; upload preflight failures stop before duplicate validation or byte upload.

## Live Token Findings

Live API checks were run on 2026-06-20 from `plugin-tester.local` using a user-provided Drime bearer token. The token is intentionally not recorded here.

- `GET /drive/file-entries?workspaceId=0&perPage=1` succeeded and returned a paginated response with keys including `current_page`, `data`, `per_page`, and `total`.
- `POST /uploads/validate?workspaceId=0` succeeded and returned `errors`, `duplicates`, and `status`.
- `POST /entry/getAvailableName` returned `available`, not the documented `name` key.
- Direct small-file upload via `POST /uploads` succeeded for a real WPvivid database backup using `relativePath=/Alynt WPvivid Test Backups/plugin-tester.local`.
- Direct upload response included `status` and `fileEntry`; the uploaded file entry included `id`, `name`, `file_size`, `parent_id`, `workspace_id`, `extension`, and path metadata.
- After relative-path upload, Drime returned a concrete `parent_id` for the created/used folder, while `backup_relative_path` was `null`.
- Duplicate validation did not detect the uploaded file when `relativePath` was sent inside each file object, when `relativePath` was sent at the top level, or when `parentId` was sent inside each file object.
- Duplicate validation did detect the uploaded file when the resolved `parentId` was sent at the top level with `files` containing only `name` and `size`.
- `getAvailableName` returned a suffixed `available` name for both an existing filename and a random unique filename, even when called with the resolved `parentId`; do not treat it as a reliable duplicate detector without more evidence.
- The plugin now stores resolved relative-path parent folder IDs in `alynt_drime_wpvivid_drime_locations`.
- LocalWP duplicate-skip validation confirmed that a copied backup with the same basename queued on the second stable scan, then returned `alynt_drime_duplicate_skipped` without creating another uploaded registry entry when the cached top-level `parentId` was used.
- Live multipart upload through the plugin uploader succeeded for a temporary 5,373,952-byte `.zip` fixture. Drime returned a multipart key and S3 entry `fileEntry` id `759842062` under parent folder id `759829073`.
- Live interrupted multipart resume succeeded for a temporary 10,551,296-byte `.zip` fixture. The first part was manually uploaded through the plugin Drime client, `get-uploaded-parts` returned one uploaded part before resume, the plugin uploader reused the same multipart key, uploaded the remaining parts, and created S3 entry `fileEntry` id `759845354` under parent folder id `759829073`.
- Live remote abort succeeded for an in-progress multipart upload after one part was uploaded manually. Calling the plugin uploader's clear-active path recorded `manual_active_upload_abort_succeeded` and left active upload state empty.
- Invalid bearer token against `GET /drive/file-entries?workspaceId=0&perPage=1` returned HTTP `401` with message `Unauthenticated.` and plugin error code `alynt_drime_api_error`.
- Live testing found Drime's direct upload path could still create a file when the plugin reached it with an invalid token, so the uploader now blocks every upload behind the JSON token preflight.
- After that hardening, invalid-token upload retry behavior is verified: the queued item remains queued, attempts increment to `1`, a failed-registry item is recorded with `Unauthenticated.`, active state stays empty, and uploaded registry count does not change.
- Temporary live Drime test files created during multipart and auth/error testing were moved to trash through `POST /file-entries/delete` with `deleteForever=false`; the real WPvivid test backup entry was not deleted.

## Still Unverified

- Malformed multipart create/sign response handling has unit coverage; HTTP `429` rate-limit handling has unit coverage. Broader live malformed payload shapes and live rate-limit payload shapes still need live testing if a safe, non-abusive trigger becomes available.
- Duplicate validation for relative-path-only workflows is not reliable from current live evidence; the plugin now works around this after the first successful relative-path upload by caching and reusing the resolved Drime parent folder ID.
- Direct small-file upload still uses PHP cURL because WordPress HTTP API does not natively model multipart/form-data file uploads cleanly.
- Fresh multipart upload, interrupted multipart resume, remote multipart abort on manual active-state clear, invalid-token auth failure, and invalid-token retry handling are live-validated.
